#### Project Overview
In the quest for a more energy-efficient future, the first crucial step involves comprehending energy consumption patterns and accurately predicting them. This project is dedicated to precisely this initial step. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, I aim to uncover insights by examining consumption patterns, detecting trends, and ultimately forecasting energy consumption based on these patterns and trends.

About the Dataset
Title: Appliances Energy Prediction
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Link: Dataset
Summary:
The dataset comprises readings taken every 10 minutes over a span of 4.5 months from a residence in Belgium. The house encompasses 7 rooms and 1 bathroom. It includes temperature and humidity data collected from both inside the building via sensors and outside from weather stations.
