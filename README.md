In the pursuit of a more energy-efficient future, the initial step towards it involves the understanding of energy consumption patterns and the ability to predict them accurately. This project is dedicated to the first initial step as its objective. Using the power of data analysis and predictive modeling, i am tryin to find insights by shedding light on consumption patterns, identifying and following the trends, and ultimately anticipating and predicting energy consumption based on these patterns and trends.![image](https://github.com/AkshayHanchate/Appliances_Energy_Prediction/assets/158104333/43aeae37-db66-4486-94bf-2ea319878464)
